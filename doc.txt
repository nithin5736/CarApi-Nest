Nest app -> module, controller
run a nest app build from scratch -> npx ts-node-dev src/main.ts

nest app -> nest new project_name
nest module -> nest generate module module_name
nest controller -> nest generate controller messages/messages --flat

Pipes and dto -> 
pipes makes easy to validate incoming requests.
dto is data transfer object which transfers data to object form.


services and repositories -->
have same methods in some cases but the main difference is that
repository is used to directly interact with database whereas 
services acts as proxy to these repositories and can use multiple repositories in a single service.


Inversion of control (IoC) -->
Classes should not create the instances of its own dependencies
This can get rid of using dependency Injection (suitable for production and fast testing) -->
create interfaces for repositories to pass any kind of object to the constructor, instead '
of creating an instance or specifically passing the exact repository object.


Dependency Injection â†’
DI container has: (use Injectable decorator on each dependency)
Registration of classes and dependencies using Injectable() decorator
DI container will take care of creating instances for us (creates only one copy of instance and shares among multiple services)
Main use of DI and IoC was testing the app is easy

Importing and Exporting services between multiple modules.
-------------------------------------------------------------

TypeORM is object relational mapper for different databases like MySQL, Postgresql, MongoDB, SQLite.
If root module is connected to a database then that database connection shared among child modules. (Appmodule -> database connection, users and reports modules also connected to database)
Database connection
SQLite(File based database) stores information in a single file

(Synchronize: true) flag --> Typeorm will automatically does migration for us. It is better to use synchronize flag in development environment rather than production environment.
			     In production environment, we need to write migration files to change the structure of database.

class-validator, class-transformer --> these packages used to validate incoming requests
whitelist: true in globalValidation pipe --> used to strip off other properties sent by user except dto properties for security purpose 
--------------------------------------------------------------

InjectRepository() --> for injecting user repository
create and save user data

Instead of direcly saving data in databases (using save() method) first we create instance of the user(create() method) and then save it to run the validation step.
hooks in typeorm --> hooks are used to define functions on an entity which are automatically called at certain points

Hooks are executed if we save user data after creating an instance not on directly saving user data. Hooks include like AfterInsert, AfterUpdate, AfterRemove, etc.
UsersService methods --> findOne(), find(), update(), remove()
update(id, Partial<User>) --> first use findOne() to get user then update (using Object.assign()) and save the user in database

In repository,
save(), remove() --> work with entity (hooks are executed here) --> these methods will take two round trips on database
insert(), update(), delete() --> work with properties of entity (hooks will not be executed here). All these methods take single round trip on database

controller methods --> findUser(), findAllUsers(), removeUser(), updateUser()
Exception like NotFoundException() instead of throwing errors (throw new NotFoundException('User not found'))
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

Interceptors(ClassSerializerInterceptor), Exclude(in class-transformer) --> to hide password from User entity instance instead of sending a plain object. But it has some downsides.
If we follow this nestJs approach then there some downsides where we can't sent a single object different properties for different routes.
So we need to use dtos for outgoing response objects also(which is used for custom serialization).

Custom interceptors can be used for incoming requests and outgoing responses.It can be applied to route handler level, controller level, global level.
Use UserDto to convert outgoing entity instance to custom plain object(plainToClass, Expose in Dto).
Here UserDto is hard coded in interceptors. So we use a constructor for this to customize.

Create and wrap the SerializeInterceptor in a Custom decorator.
Apply the serialize decorator to whole controller for controller wide serialization

Type Safety around serialization --> If we pass any kind of value like string, number in Serialize Decorator it won't show you any error. So create an interface of any Class type and 
				     instead of type any replace it with interface type. Serialize decorator must accept a class.
interface ClassConstructor {
  new (...args: any[]) : {}
}
This interface represents a class. Here, that class is UserDto which basically has constructor and accepts an array of arguments and returns an empty object.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authentication
/signup 
/signin
cookies
Use Authservice(/signup,/signin) makes use of Userservice

UsersModule --> Usercontroller, Userservice, Authservice, Userrepository
Hierarchy of dependency in Usermodule

Authservice depends on Usersservice --> Dependency Injection
signup() in Authservice

Hashing password --> salt and hash function
Creating and Saving the user inside database

signin() in Authservice --> retrieve the password with given email and hash the signin password and compare the both passwords.

Cookie-Session is used to handle sessions (Example with colors)
Adding cookie-session for signin and signup --> storing userId in a cookie

Getting current signedin user using userId stored in cookie
Sign out --> setting session userId with null

Guard --> if a user is not signed in then we reject the request to the route handler
Interceptor + Decorator --> automatically tells a route handler who is the current user

Custom Decorator(createParamDecorator) --> to know about current user 
ExecutionContext --> incoming request

To get current user using decorator we need --> session object and user service instance
But decorator can't get access to user service instance due to DI system. Decorators are not part of DT system.
So, we use interceptor to get user service instance and decorator, give it to current user decorator to get access to current user.

CurrentUser Interceptor using Nest Interceptor --> make use of request object to pass userId to currentUser decorator

Connecting CurrentUser Interceptor to DI system
First we need to run Currentuser interceptor then currentuser decorator to return current user
It has a downside when there are multiple controllers then we need to import this Currentuser interceptor multiple places

Globally scoped CurrentUser Interceptor

Guards --> if user is not siged in then route handler rejects the request (similar to interceptors can be applied route handler level, controller level, global level)
UseGaurds(AuthGuard) -->
		- if it returns true, the request will be processed.
		- if it returns false, Nest will deny the request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unit testing --> test individual methods of a class are working correctly or not.
Integration testing --> test full flow of a feature in a app.
Testing AuthService --> To test the methods in AuthService, we need to create instance of UsersService as AuthService depends on it. Similarly, UsersRepository and SQLite configuration.
So, we gonna create a Fake UsersService to test AuthService.

Test on creating an instance of AuthService --> First create testing container with all dependencies then create a fakeUserservice. Test finally.

We created a fake UserService which has two methods find(), create(). Whenever UserService is needed, we provide with value of fakeUserService in return.
Created a basic version of Userservice in a fakeUsersService.

Making the fake UsersService type annotation correct as same as UsersService.

Adding beforeEach() and describe() to look more organize

Test for signup() --> ensure password gets hashed

Test for signup() --> email already in use (overriding find() of fakeUsersService in this test case)

Test for signin() --> unused email

Test for signin() --> invalid password

Test for signin() --> correct password, first run signup() method for your password and use the resultant hashed password to test
                  --> best method to test is to create an user array to store them and test accordingly 

Refactor other tests for AuthService by removing the custom find() methods in fakeUsersService

Controller unit testing --> Create fakeUsersService, fakeAuthService with methods being utiized in controller

Add fakeUsersService, fakeAuthService into testing DI container
write mock methods for findOne(), find() in fakeUsersService to test findUser(), findAllUsers() methods of controller

Written unit tests for findAllUsers() , findUser() methods in controller

Witten unit test for signin() --> check whether id set for session object
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

End to End --> it is used to test entire application working as expected.
               For example, Authentication flow(sign up->sign out->sign in).
               For each test it creates new instance of application and runs
               corresponding tests

Written test for signup() --> send(user details) and expect using .then()

While you are importing app module, here main.ts file is not executed before
doesn't allow to use cookies and pipes. So, one easy way is to create 
and intialize them in a seperate file and import them in both test and 
main.ts files, then run the tests to get rid of errors.

Another way is to set up middlewares(cookies, pipes) in app module itself
instead of in main.ts file. As for every incoming request its gonna be executed.
Setting up the validation Pipe globally in app module providers.
{ provide: APP_PIPE, useValue: new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true }) }

Similarly, set up the cookie session middleware also which gonna execute
for every incoming request.
set them up using consumer middleware in app module class for all routes.
configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
    consumer
      .apply(
        cookieSession({
          keys: ['abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'],
        }),
      )
      .forRoutes('*');
  }

best way to get rid of error of email already in use/ registering same user
several time while testing several times is to use seperate databases for
development and testing modes.
So that we can wipe the database and create new instance of app for every
time we run our tests.

Using seperate databases for development and testing can be done with the
help of environment variables. Next, thing is we need to wipe the data
from the test database for every test we run. 
In Nest, it is complicated to use environment varaibles. So, for that
we create a configService in a DI container on which TypeOrmModule is dependent.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on Nest approach we are going to create two .env files for development
and testing seperately. Using ConfigService we read the values and use it.

ConfigMoudle --> This module is mainly used to tell which environment is
                 used currently
ConfigService --> This service is used to read values from .env files based
                  on current environment
These both things are applied globally. ConfigService is used with the help
of DI.
ConfigModule.forRoot({
  isGlobal: true,
  envFilePath: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}`,
}),
TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
  inject: [ConfigService],
  useFactory: (config: ConfigService) => {
  return {
      type: 'sqlite',
      database: config.get<string>('DB_NAME'),
      entities: [User, Report],
      synchronize: true,
    };
  },
}),

Next task is to specify the environments whether it is development or testing.
This can be done by specifying in package.json file using NODE_ENV for several
scripts like start or test.
We can easily specify using a package called cross-env in any type of system OS.

Here, we got an error that database is locked. This error generated due to
creating two app instances for app and auth spec files and accessing the
test database simultaneously. So here multiple tests are running and access'
database at same time. To get rid of this error we try to run one test at
a single time.

We are getting Internal Server Error because of same email is been used for
registering. So we need to wipe out the database after every test. That can
be done in two ways.
1. Delete all rows from database table to delete the data.
2. Delete the databases before each test. 
So, we use a global beforeEach to delete the database that means removing
the test.sqlite file from directory.
"setupFilesAfterEnv" : ["<rootDir>/setup.ts"] --> this is executed before each test

Next lets try to test signup then check who is currently signed user.
Creating a follow up request after sign up to check currently signed in 
user is valid or not.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

User submits the details of a car by creating a report.
User submits this report(millege,price,...) to a backend database. 
Whenever other user asks for that car report we return submitted estimate.

Adding other properties in Report entity like make, millege, latitude,...

Lets try to make a route to create a post. Use Dtos to validate 
incoming request.

Applying validation rules for Report entity so that global validation pipe
will validate incoming request. Injecting ReportsService in ReportsController.
A valid authenticated user only can submit the report.

InjectRepository() of report entity into reports service. 
create() method in reports service.

Make a request for create method to create a report after user sign in.

Associations between user and report. We add a user_id column in reports
table to know which user created that report. Associations between entities
are complex.

There are different types of associations between entities. In our case,
it is one-to-many association w.r.t user to report. It depends on perspective.
A user can have multiple reports.

Add ManyToOne and OneToMany decorators on report and user entities. It will
automatically adds a new column user_id on report entity.
Delete the existing database also to avoid errors.

First argument of association decorators tells to which entity we are 
associated with. As it is circular dependency, so thats why we make use of
function.
Second argument take the associated entity instance as a parameter and returns
current entity instance.(how it maps from user to reports in report entity)
It is mainly used when there are two kinds of users like creator and approver
of a report entity.

Setting up the associations between entities after creating. Using CurrentUser
decorator to associate user instance with report entity instance.
But the response has password in it, so we need to hide that.

Instead sending all properties of user as a response associated with report,
we only send the id of that user record in report instance userId property.

Formatting and Transform using dtos. transform and Expose peroperties of
class-transformer.
@Transform(({obj}) => obj.user.id)
